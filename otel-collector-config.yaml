      # The OTLP receiver listens for incoming telemetry data.
      # It supports both gRPC and HTTP protocols.
      # This allows the collector to receive data from various sources like applications and services.
      # The OTLP receiver is essential for collecting telemetry data in a standardized format.

      # The endpoint specifies where the OTLP receiver listens for incoming data.
      # In this case, it listens on port 4318 for both gRPC and HTTP protocols.
      # This endpoint is used by applications and services to send telemetry data to the collector.
